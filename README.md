# "This is delighful"
"These violent delights have violent ends"; i just needed a quote that had the word delight in it... I hope this doesn't end like Romeo and Juliet :-/
In any case, I think Shakespeare is delightful. 

This is a place to register "delightful" experiences. Delightful can be construed as MBA speak for those moments in which a business creates a unique, wonderful, ecstatic, sublime etc. experience for a customer, but we can be a little loose about whether it falls into that genre. 
Let's say we keep it open such that any moment where you can turn around and say "oh yeah, *that* was delightful" can be added here.

# Instructions
1. For each new experience, create a .md file named by date and title in /logs.
2. Inside each .md, write the story, memory, photo links, whatever you want.
